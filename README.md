# Problem Statement
Yulu is Indiaâ€™s leading micro-mobility service provider, which offers unique vehicles for the daily commute. Yulu has recently suffered considerable dips in its revenues.
The company wants to understand:
Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared electric cycles in the Indian market?
How well those variables describe the electric cycle demands?

# Insights
- Season and weather has significant impact on the number of users (casual or registered)
- Time also plays crucial role in the reducing the users, specific time of the day have very few users availing the service
- Significant difference in the number of casual and registered users availing the service
- Temp & atemp also has affecting the number of users availing service, sunny the temperature, more people will use it.
- During holidays and working days, there has been seen huge drop in number of users availing services
- Windspeed and humidity are external factors. Humidity is not playing any role in the number of users though. Higher the Windspeed, less number of users are availing service

# Recommendations
- Since weather & temperature is affecting the experience of the customer, bikes can be provided with a shed in it or an umbrella to protect themselves during th high temperatures or a rainee weather so they can use it whenever necessary. This will help change the mindset of the user who wants to use the bike but can't due to weather / temp concerns. It will also help during some of the windspeed challenges but not to full extent.
- Since during night time, people are not preferring bike, it can be further investigated if it's due to safety concerns. If the safety is a concern, emergency features can be added to the bike which will allow customer to connect with the service station, nearby police station or nearby hospital to get necessary help which will encourage customers to use it without worries.
- During working days, more people are availing the service, and during holidays or weekends, less number of people are availing the service. Location of the bike parking stations needs to further researched, is this because bike parking stations are only available in the locality where there are offices and not available where the local market places are for the easy commute. If that's the case, then more bike parking stations can be offered in the locality where there will be more crowd during weekends. eg. market places, parks, etc.
- During holidays or weekends, bikes can be offered at a discounted rates to encourage customers to avail service.
- During holidays or weekends, bike services can be emphasized as the preferred mode of transportation, highlighting the aspects of health, enjoyment, and recreational rides. This approach can attract individuals who are seeking a health-conscious and enjoyable way to travel.
